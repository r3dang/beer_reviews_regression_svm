Also, an inch of initial head is present but quickly disappears like a normal pale lager.\t\tAlthough Buckler isn't the strongest tasting non-alcoholic beer I've encountered, but if you're a pale lager or Heineken fan, I would strongly recommend Buckler for you.

A half point less impressive perhaps.\t\tThe nose isn't quite what it could be. Grain is the obvious focal point, but it smells stale and musty compared to the Clausthaler.

On the positive side of the ledger, it's less strongly flavored, which makes it less offensive than it otherwise might be. It also strikes me as a very poor imitation of beer, and in fact, is barely recognizable as such. None of the usual rules apply, so I'm having difficulty coming up with beer-like descriptors to convey the flavor. 'Bad' and 'not much' will have to suffice.\t\tThe finish is mineral-like and slightly sour, and the mouthfeel is as light and as flat as it is on the other beer.

When doing these head-to-heads, I try to maintain some sort of theme rather than throwing two completely unrelated beers into the ring. 'Germany's finest' seems as good a theme as any, although I'll see in just a few minutes how fine the beer really is. One thing is certain, at least I'll be clear-eyed and clear-brained throughout.\t\tThe beer is a much darker and richer amber than the St. Pauli; not that remarkable since the other beer was acid-washed straw in color. The foam is also a few shades darker, more ivory than glaring white. Consistency-wise, the head looks just as good, persists just as long and lays down just as much lace. A pleasantly surprising look to both beers, but now the real competition begins...\t\tSee the St. Pauli review for a description of the nose, but the short answer is 'nasty'. I keep going back and forth between the two glasses trying to pick up the slightest difference between them, but haven't managed to do so. For all intents and purposes, they smell identical. And identically bad.\t\tCompared to its competitor, Beck's Alkoholfrei is Westvleteren 12. Not really, but it is noticeably superior even if it's still pretty crapalicious. I don't experience quite the same level of revulsion when the liquid hits my tastebuds, though they still shrink in horror at what I've subjected them too. Even though a higher taste score will likely carry this beer to victory, it's still lousy.\t\tLike the flavor, the mouthfeel is nothing to write home about, but it shines in comparison to St. Pauli's mouthfeel. At least there's a little (very little) volume and smoothness. Neither beer's carbonation is notable; they're neither under- nor over-bubbled.\t\tI haven't yet put in the numbers, but it's obvious that Beck's Alkoholfrei/Non-Alcoholic is the better of these two products and is, therefore, the winner of the first NA Shootout (With Blanks). It isn't the best one of these low alchohol beers that I've ever had, but is drinkable in a pinch.

I've always wondered why brewers who decide to tackle this style don't brew something other than pale lagers and the occasional amber lager.

I know that alcohol is an integral component of beer, but I never dreamed that removing it would make such a difference.\t\tThe mouthfeel isn't half bad, considering. It's light-medium and wheaty smooth with much less carbonation than I had feared. What does it matter when the vehicle is carrying such lousy cargo?\t\tErdinger Weissbier Alkoholfrei is not a good low alcohol beer. Needless to say, it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath with a real hefe weizen. In fact, this would have been a better experience if it was flavorfrei.

Snowdrifts linger inside the bottle, and the glass never loses its thick layer of suds. The beer is golden, and hazy but not glowing the way some hefes can be. There is some wax, pepper and clove in the aroma; the smell is perhaps the most weizen-like feature. The taste is predominately sweet, with some light graininess and grapefruit hop. It's oddly reminiscent of an American extra pale ale, like Full Sail. Cookie dough lingers on the tongue. Winter spices are here also, weird but not in a bad way. I've noticed in NA beers a certain bread-staleness which is normally masked or preserved in regular beer by the alcohol. Here it is not too intrusive. It's a tasty beer, with a full if not sensuous mouthfeel, and good drinkability. It is, surprisingly, closer to my dreamed-of NA bitter than I would have expected.", 'user/profileName': 'Thrasher', 'review/aroma': 3.5}

So, as I prepare to drink and review my first one, the option of reviewing it *as* a low alcohol beer (in other words, in comparison with others of the style) isn't an option. Reviewing it as beer doesn't seem fair either. Therefore, I have decided to review two such offerings in a comparison tasting. By reviewing the current #3 (this one) side-by-side with the current #21 (Warsteiner Premium Fresh), I hope to find out what makes a beer of this style good, or at least palatable. Enough introductory nonsense, on with the show...\t\tLucent golden amber that appears darker than most light beers and is several shades darker than its competitor. The head is a fine thing indeed; eggshell in color with plenty of stickiness and a characterful texture that would make beer of any style proud. There's quite a bit of chunky lace on the glass that looks as if it won't be washed away easily. This one has nothing to be ashamed about so far.\t\tClausthaler Premium has the clear advantage when it comes to the nose. There's a pleasant, bright, fresh grain, citrusy aroma emanating from the glass that trounces anything currently being brewed by the Big 3 and most Euro pale lagers. This really is high-quality stuff, alcohol or not.\t\tTaste is where these two really suffer. This one looks and smells good, but that's where the party ends. Maybe alcohol really does make an important (critical it seems) contribution to the flavor of any given beer. It's hard to put into words, but it tastes fake, as if the brewers tried to pass it off as beer without using any of the usual ingredients. There's very little grain flavor and the bright, slightly citric, character of the aroma is long gone.\t\tThe finish is a little vegetal and lingers longer than I would like. The body is light beer light and the mouthfeel matches the flavor in being overly flat. Clausthaler Premium needs something badly and that something is alcohol. But then it would cease being what it is and what's the point in that? Well...\t\tIf this is the #3 low alcohol beer on the planet then this is a style that has a looong way to go. I wouldn't think it would be that hard to brew a decent beer with low or no alcohol, but then my brewing knowledge would fit comfortably on the head of a pin.

Carib Brewery says of this beer, "Malta Carib has a pleasant, sweet taste, enhanced by a hint of bitterness derived from hops and is a wholly natural drink made from malted barley containing energy boosting carbohydrates, minerals and proteins all needed for physical well being." And if you believe all that, I have a great bridge to sell you...\t\tTo put it bluntly, Malta was the worst beer or beer-like product I have ever tried, and I once ran afoul of a Milwaukee\'s Best Light! But maybe my review will shed some light on this drink:\t\tIt pours a dark brown-black and becomes tar black wih a frothy tan-and-khaki head that fades quite fast. The best thing about Malta is its smell, which reminded me of a mocha cappuccino that you might get from Seattle\'s Best coffee or a second-rate Starbuck\'s. Malta starts exactly like heavily sweetened and lightly creamed coffee. It tastes (not surprisingly) like coffee and chocolate, thought neither is very pleasing. I thought it had no beer-like flavor or texture at all. Malta is nonetheless full-bodied, and its finish is creamy and a litle like a soft drink. This concoction\'s aftertaste is heavy and milky in flavor.\t\tPerhaps Carib Brewery is right and I\'ve been too harsh on Malta Carib, but if you are ever brave enough to try this drink, don\'t expect to be reminded of anything but a half-baked stout.', 'user/profileName': 'theozag', 'review/aroma': 1.5}

And because of this, Sharp's does not represent American Lagers, not to mention, N.A. beers, with deference.\t\tAs stated from the last article, American Lagers are beers made with rice and corn and are primarily found in North America. Popular American Lagers are Miller Light and Bud Light. \t\tJust like Busch N.A., Sharp's has the initial appearance of an authentic American Lager, until it settles into the glass. The head quickly disappears to leave a slight white coating that bears a resemblance to scum on a pond. When the carbonation bubbles disappear, an almost clear blonde body appears. \t\tSharp's smell is of a sweet and bitter mixture. Hints of hops and barely are also present in the smell. The taste also has a bitter sweet sensation with a dry and flat aftertaste. Personally, Sharp's is the only macro-brew American Lager that has a sweet flavor and aroma, which makes Sharp's not authentic to it's alcoholic parallels. \t\tMaybe Miller decided a bitter sweet essence would set a part Sharp's from other American Lagers, but for the purposes of assimilating a non alcoholic beer into the mainstream the beer needs to resemble a familiar beer flavor for beer drinkers to respond positively. \t\tOverall, I would rate Sharp's as a D based on the authenticity of its smell, flavor and awesomeness.

Shootout (With Blanks) IV will be a contest between this English entry and Buckler, the pride of Holland. Or, if you prefer, between the breweries themselves, Guinness Ltd. and Heineken Brouwerijen. Which one of these giants can brew the most palatable low alcohol beer? If the first three contests in the series were any indication, it'll come down to which one is the least offensive.\t\tI don't believe I've ever seen such a stark difference in color between two beers in any of my head-to-head matchups. Kaliber is pale orange and Buckler is sun-bleached straw. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Guinness uses caramel coloring. The heads are both more than respectable. This one is off-white and the other is bright white. Since I have no preference regarding the colors, the appearance scores should be the same.\t\tKaliber's nose is the weaker of the two and smells quite a bit less like beer. There's no real offensiveness since there isn't much present to offend. Even though I'm going to give the edge to its competitor, I appreciate the fact that I can venture near this glass as many times as I want without experiencing that typical N.A. nastiness.\t\tThe difference on the palate is even more pronounced. The flavor tastes fake to me. I know that malt extract is occasionally used in home brewing and that I probably couldn't tell the difference between it and all-grain in the hands of someone who knows what he's doing. So instead of malt extract, let's just say that Kaliber tastes like beer made with beer extract. Not good.\t\tThere isn't much difference in the mouthfeels since both are lighter than light. In terms of carbonation, though, this beer is the clear loser because it doesn't have enough bubbles. There's nothing like a lack of carbonation to make a light-bodied beer feel lousy in the mouth.\t\tIt looks like Guinness has taken it on the chin in N.A. Shootout (With Blanks) IV. This isn't anywhere close to good low alcohol beer, although it isn't quite the worst version that I've ever had.

Finish was slightly sweet, very lager-like, definitely the best so far this afternoon. Frankly, I bought a sixer on Wednesday at the local Giant supermarket and drank one at room temperature while waiting for the bus on a hot, humid afternoon and I liked it just fine then. I liked it a lot more now, chilled down. I could find space in the cooler if I knew someone wanted an NA beer.", 'user/profileName': 'woodychandler', 'review/aroma': 3.0}

As a beer lover in general, I was surprised N.A. beer still has the realistic taste of "authentic" beer but no ability to make one act drunk and foolish. My current mission is to taste test all of the N.A. beer I can get my hands on and critique each for authenticity, color, clarity, and awesomeness.\t\t \t\tThe first beer on my safe and sober journey is Busch NA. For starters, Busch NA is brewed by Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, Mo. Its famous alcoholic counterparts are Busch and Busch Light which were introduced into the mainstream market in 1979. All are considered American Lager beers. American Lager is a common light beer made with primarily rice and corn and is usually brewed in North America. Examples of famous American Lager beer are, Coors, Miller Light, and Bud Light.\t\t \t\tBusch N.A. has common physical similarities to genuine American Lagers such as Old Style, Blatz, and of course, Busch Light. Once poured and settled into a glass, Busch N.A. looks like champaign, as light bubbles float to the surface. Also, a small white head a half of finger in width gravitates to the top of the glass. When comparing Busch N.A. primarily on physical appearance I have to conclude it mirrors its alcoholic equivalents superbly.\t\t \t\tSurprisingly, the taste of Busch N.A. also closely resembles the authenticity of an American Lager. The main quality of an American Lager is a light-flavored taste. All American Lagers have this quality but every beer is different; hence the reason for different variations of American Lagers on the market. Unlike most American Lager N.A. beers, Busch N.A., has a very distinct bitter taste often associated in alcoholic equivalents Old Style and Pabst Blue Ribbon. Instead of criticizing Anheuser-Busch for that, I praise them for taking a beer that is meant to resemble a bitter, light-flavored American Lager and present it in a non-alcoholic version.\t\t \t\tThe only downfall to Busch N.A. is the outer appearance. At first glance, the can resembles its alcoholic equivalent. So if your goal is to be an undetected responsible drinker, this would be a good choice. The only downfall is a fairly large NA stamp on the front, but a grip around the lettering can easily solve this problem.\t\tI give Busch N.A. an B+ for awesomeness! If your beers of preference are American Lagers with a hint of bitterness then try a safe alternative, Busch N.A. The makers of Busch N.A. have truly created an excellent non alcoholic beer which does not hide the American Lager authentic taste.', 'user/profileName': 'feroc34', 'review/aroma': 3.0}

Nice spacer, if you\'re just lookin\' for something that resembles the taste of beer...which I was...and to give the alkie a rest. I know, it\'s sad...but what the hell...gotta do it sometimes. OH, and it has only 60 g of calories, and 12.9 g of carbs! Much like a light beer, just a little higher in the carb department, but lower in the calories. This stuff is probably somewhat good for you too! Give it a try! You\'ll be surprised, I think. Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!', 'user/profileName': 'musicjustintime', 'review/aroma': 2.5}

This is a 12 oz. twist-off capped bottle with a '21MAR08' Born On Date. Poured at home to a pint glass...\t\t'RICH AND FLAVORFUL' is imprinted on label and cap.\t\tA: What a strange head. Huge, well over 4-fingers, and an off-white creamy/soapy froth that sits for quite a while before slowly receding. Liquid is a crystal clear copper/light amber with a scattering of bubbles floating to the foamy ceiling. What lace there is sticks in broad splotches.\t\tS: Very faint aroma of grainy malt and maybe a hint of nuts; smells a bit dusty and has a slight tart fruitiness. Even as this warms, there's not really an improvement/strengthening of the aroma.\t\tT: Initial sip was fairly benign, with a slight tinny backing to light, caramel malts that smack of sweet corn. Thin grassy/floral hops. Dries in the finish to a a chalkier bitterness. Can claim to be 'flavorful', but the flavors aren't necessarily any good.\t\tM: Thin and watered down feeling, seems like this was run through a strainer several times over to produce a blander, weakened essence of an Amber. An odd gummy maltiness clings to the back of the tongue and makes me reach for the tongue-scraper.\t\tD: I get that this is a non-alcoholic beer, but when it repeatedly claims to be 'rich and flavorful' I expected much more. This has always been one of those creations I just don't get; it's similar to decaf coffee in the way it attempts to alter a beverage's 'bad' traits to make it accessible to someone who might not be able to enjoy it otherwise.

May the best beer-like beverage win.\t\tO'Doul's Amber is actually rustic orange with tangerine edges. It's much darker and richer looking than its competitor, but then that was by design. Although there are many more visible bubbles in this beer, the head doesn't look nearly as good. It's beige in color and is soft and frothy rather than bubbly and sticky. Soap sudsy lace makes a brief appearance on the glass.\t\tThe aroma is remarkably low on power. A hint of minimally toasted grain greets my nose... and not much else. While there's nothing much here to like, it's vastly superior to the olfactory mess coming from the German NA. Definite edge to the American.\t\tIt's obvious that Anheuser-Busch has decided that the best way to get people to drink NA beer, a historically bad tasting style, is to eliminate virtually all traces of flavor. Michelob Ultra has more flavor than this stuff. Interestingly, a faint burst of sweet, faintly caramel-like malt becomes apparent on the finish. I say 'interestingly' because the finish is preceded by absolutely no flavor whatsoever.\t\tNo surprise that the mouthfeel is on the light side. It earns some measure of respect though by failing to descend into wateriness and by having a 'just right' amount of carbonation.

Will it be a titanic struggle reminiscent of WW II or will it be a pathetic bout between two scared little girls? I'm betting on the latter, but let's see how things shake out.\t\tPale amber. The colors are virtually identical, with this beer perhaps being a quarter shade lighter when held up to my sunlit front window. An average amount of visible carbonation leads up to a white cap of somewhat stiff, nearly featureless foam that hangs around for a while. It's a decent look.\t\tThe nose is actually semi-pleasant. There isn't much there except lightly toasted grain, but then there doesn't need to be. The very fact that there's almost none of the nastiness that is rampant in the noses of most low alcohol beer is a major victory. A clear win for the Yank.\t\tO'Doul's might just be the best NA beer that I've ever had. It doesn't taste anything at all like good beer, but it does taste like what I expected good beer of this style to taste like. I've been disappointed that none, until now, have measured up. To be short and to the point, it tastes like barley flavored water. Again, to some that might be a ghastly sounding description, but with little or no alcohol involved, nothing better than that will ever be possible.\t\tThe mouthfeels are both light and borderline watery. The only difference is in the amount of carbonation. Despite the fact that this beer had more visible carbonation right after the pour, it's more subdued in the mouth at this point in time. I'm thinking identical scores here. \t\tI don't know whether it'll be reflected in the score of not, but I think that O'Doul's is the best low alcohol beer that I've ever had. It's certainly the least offensive, and that's all that really matters when it comes to the impossible task of brewing good beer while leaving out one of its essential ingredients.

Even there, it is just as cheep to get a regular cheepo beer in a can from the distributor so it doesn't save money. I don't get it? Pours clear, nothing but grain in the nose, little if any taste and very wimpy in the mouth. Simply boring!\t\tHope this is helpful.\tCheers!", 'user/profileName': 'Phatz', 'review/aroma': 2.0}

On the palette, the beer feels like a standard macro-lager with a high-moderate amount of carbonation. As mentioned, it does taste like beer. The flavor is grainy with some wet paper flavors.

It is "dusty" and dry both in flavor and mouthfeel--it does not feel like beer but rather more like club soda or tonic. It is relatively easy to drink and smells/tastes just like a premium U.S. lager at first sip, but the lack of substantial alcohol makes this beer taste less and less like beer and more like something other than beer as you drink it. It is a passable and "safe" alternative for beer when you want something to cool off with or wash down food. It is only 65 calories, so a good choice if you want to eliminate empty calories from your diet.

Don't expect any bloodshed since they're firing blanks after all.\t\tThomasBrau's color is simple amber. Actually, it's darker than expected, but still pales in comparison to its (probably) artificially-colored counterpart. This beer is clearly superior when it comes to head and lace. The ivory cap looks amazing, considering the style, and deposits an impressive amount of attractive lace as well.\t\tThe nose on this beer is nasty, there's just no other way to say it. It smells like a combination of clay, wallpaper paste and wet cardboard. I might chalk all that up to age, but it isn't an old bottle. I hope that it tastes vastly different than it smells or this Shootout will be over almost before it begins.\t\tThis stuff is vile, vile, vile and should be considered the undisputed poster child for the worst aspects of NA beer. It tastes pretty much like it smells, so please don't ask me to run through the murderer's row of crapalicious aromas/flavors again. O'Doul's Amber is the outlier here. ThomasBrau is how most low alcohol beer tastes, at least in my limited experience.\t\tThe body/mouthfeel is really no different on this beer in terms of heft (if that word is even appropriate to describe something so incredibly light in the mouth). Where it loses ground is in terms of carbonation. There's very little here and it gives the beer an insipid feel that does the ghastly flavor no favors.\t\tPaulaner's ThomasBrau lost NA Shootout (With Blanks) II as soon as I got a whiff of it. I went through the motions of evauating the rest of its attributes though, despite the fact that I was repulsed each time I forced myself to drink a mouthful.
